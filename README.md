## Game Rules: how should one organize all the diagrams and so on for a development project?
Organizing diagrams and other project-related artifacts is an important aspect of any development project. Here are some tips on how to effectively organize them:

1. Define a clear directory structure: Create a directory structure that makes it easy to find the diagrams and other project artifacts. The structure should be based on the project's needs and should be well-documented.

2. Use version control: Use a version control system like Git to manage changes to the diagrams and other artifacts. This will make it easy to roll back changes if needed, and it will also make it easy to collaborate with others.

3. Use consistent naming conventions: Use consistent naming conventions for the files and directories. This will make it easier to find the files you need, especially if you have a lot of diagrams and artifacts.

4. Use a tool for diagramming: Use a tool like Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, or draw.io to create the diagrams. These tools offer features like templates, automatic alignment and sizing, and real-time collaboration that can help you create professional-looking diagrams quickly.

5. Store diagrams with related documentation: Store diagrams and other project artifacts with the related documentation, such as requirements or design documents. This will make it easier to find all the information related to a specific aspect of the project in one place.

6. Document the diagrams: Document the diagrams by adding annotations, descriptions, or notes. This will help others understand the purpose and context of the diagrams.

7. Backup regularly: Make sure to backup all the diagrams and project artifacts regularly. This will protect against data loss in case of a hardware failure or other disaster.

By following these tips, you can effectively organize your diagrams and other project artifacts, making it easier to manage the development project.
